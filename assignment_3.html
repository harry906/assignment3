        <h4>Team name</h4>

            <p align="justify">After participating in the long discussion, Group 1 has all together made the decision to officially adopt the
            name "The Boi's cave" as our appointed group identity. The decision made is an expression of our common goal and
            displays the dynamic and open personality of our team. By adopting this unique appellation, our objective is to
            grow spirit of mutual respect and support among our members, while simultaneously highlighting our individual
            capacities and different points of view. Under the name of "The Boi's Cave", we find ourselves on a point of an
            incredible journey filled with exploration, innovation, and achievement.</p>

        <h4>Personal information</h4>

        <ul> 
            <li align="justify">My name is Do Thanh Luan, and my student ID is s3975161. I am currently part of The Bois Cave team. I work in IT
            but when I need a break from the stresses of everyday life, I like to entertain my friends with games that pique
            their interest. I am interested in a career in IT as the pay and job stability are very attractive. My genuine
            enthusiasm for the complex world of IT, where analytical problem solving expands, is complemented by a natural
            talent for solving complex computing challenges. In addition, I take great pleasure in exploring different
            literary genres as my never-ending interest is always satisfied. Additionally, my path into web development
            allows me to seamlessly combine creativity with technical skills. My interest in IT was sparked by the film
            Misson Impossible, which Tom Cruise is working on with a hacker. The concise presentation of the topic had an
            important effect on me and confirmed my belief in the compatibility of an IT profession and my skills and
            hobbies.</li>
            <br>
            <li align="justify"> My name is Chau Ngan Hong and here is my SID: s3813338. During my final semester of my academic career at RMIT
            Vietnam, I had the opportunity to deepen my professional application in both English and Vietnamese languages.
            Additionally, I am embarking on an exciting new adventure exploring Chinese learning and multicultural
            experiences. In addition, I read various books, follow a healthy lifestyle, and enjoy playing video games in my
            free time. IT is more than just a hobby for me. I like it because I see how it can transform businesses in the
            modern world. This convinced me to integrate IT subjects into my major. Due to my ambitious goals, I am
            passionate about leveraging the latest innovations such as AI, cloud computing and data-driven analytics. Now
            I'm part of a great young solo group called The Bois Cave who are exploring the vast possibilities of IT.</li>
            <br>    
            <li align="justify"> I am Nguyen Ngoc Huy, and my SID is s3975935. I am also a member of The Bois Cave team. I am currently enrolled
            as a freshman at RMIT Vietnam and IT is my major. As for my hobbies, I do a variety of activities. At the
            weekend, for example, I took part in a friendly badminton match with my friends. I also often went to a café
            where I spent time socializing and relaxing. I also developed joy in playing games and music. Since the
            beginning of 11th grade, I have developed a strong passion for programming. For this reason, I decided to start
            studying Python, which will be my first programming language. It should also be emphasized that the IT sector is
            experiencing continuous growth. This realization was a strong motivation for me to pursue academic studies at
            RMIT University. In this way I would like to expand my knowledge and improve my programming skills.</li>
            <br>    
            <li align="justify"> My name is Do Tuan Anh (SID: s3988516), and I am also taking part in the team “The Bois Cave”. As for my
            hobbies, I usually prefer playing video games and listening to podcasts in my free time. In addition, I work
            part-time at my uncle's shop throughout, as I am determined to finance my personal expenses independently. I
            chose IT as my major because I wanted to go deeper into the study of modern technologies and their possible
            improvements. Additionally, my older brother has been instrumental in inspiring me in the field of science,
            especially in the areas of programming and computer science. Regardless of my experience, I am relatively new to
            this field and therefore can only offer limited contributions at this time. Ultimately, my goal after completing
            this course is to further expand my contacts with industry experts and gain useful knowledge from their
            expertise.</li>

        <h2 style="color: blue" id="tools">Tools</h2>

        <h2 style="color: blue" id="project">Project Description</h2>
    
            <h3>Topic</h3>
    
                <p>Our team recognized the need for effectiveness, accessibility, and fast responses for the medical industry in
                today's growing society. With this realization, our team has developed an app called EasyMed aimed at all
                consumers with the aim of helping to meet the needs of accessible and flexible healthcare services with a
                user-friendly interface that provides quick and easy medical assistance. Additionally, EasyMed can further
                improve healthcare service experiences by allowing users to self-diagnose and treat minor to moderate
                injuries/illnesses without having to worry about a hospital visit.</p>
    
                <p>The app has some combination key features that improve the overall user experience and promote effective
                healthcare decision making. By providing users with basic information about their health status, the integrated
                X-ray function offers a significant improvement in self-diagnosis. Additionally, the availability of a live chat
                feature that allows users to have conversations with medical professionals 24/7 ensures easy access to medical
                advice that is just a few taps away on the phone. This app proves to be beneficial since it reduces the demand
                on hospital facilities while maintaining rapid care. Moreover, the implementation of prescription functionality
                reduces the process by allowing medical professionals to provide prescribed medications to the customers or
                pharmacies. Furthermore, EasyMed's booking systems promise clients to access hospital appointments without long
                wait periods (in case of emergency).</p>
    
            <h3>Motivation</h3>

                <p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.iedunote.com/img/1374/motivation-definition-meaning.jpg" width="300" align="left"></p>
                
                <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column;">
                    <p align="justify">In recent years, the IT sector has developed far beyond the mere expansion method. Additionally, the IT sector is
                    increasingly involved in business decision-making as technology adoption is critical to sustaining the growth
                    and improvement of an industry, particularly healthcare. In addition, the implementation of IT has significantly
                    improved efficiency in several areas of healthcare facilities with the ability to control data and improve
                    customer services.</p>
        
                    <p align="justify">One of the main reasons we are working on the project is to make it easier for our target customers and
                    healthcare professionals to communicate with each other by establishing a single platform with many services
                    available. The trend in IT towards digital health and healthcare makes our project more relevant to the demand
                    of customers who want quick and convenient answers to their treatment. When considering our potential value to a
                    future employer, it is important to recognize that our skills extend beyond our IT understanding. Additionally,
                    we have demonstrated our understanding of predicting market demand and designing a user-friendly interface.
                    Finally, our project shows how committed we are to creative concepts to make it easier for people to receive
                    healthcare.</p>
                </div>
            
            <h3 style=clear:left >Landscape</h3>
    
                <p>The digital healthcare industry is vast with various platforms that offer a range of medical services. Therefore,
                there are plenty of opportunities for new players to come to this market. Some of the competitor platforms are
                all extant and convey their goals in achieving a better healthcare environment through virtue assistance While
                applications like MyChart offer flexibility in scheduling medical appointments, other platforms like Doctor on
                Demand and Teladoc are more specialised in providing online doctor consultations. There is also an app called
                Ada that gives customers the ability to self-diagnose illnesses. Therefore, different competitors in this space
                need to bring their own distinctive features into their services to convince consumers.</p>
    
                <p>In contrast, our project is characterised by being well thought out. Instead of giving our customers the hurdle
                of downloading different apps on their phone, our app provides all the services with the above features in one
                and eliminates the time spent switching between apps. Overall, our approach helps customers acquire a coherent
                and more thorough medical background while ensuring a comfortable and relaxed use of our services.</p>

    <h2 style="color: blue" id="detail">Detailed Description</h2>

    <h3>Aims</h3>

    <p><image src="https://mpsinternational.in/publicimages/thumb/page/400x400/mps-international_file_116576647.png"></p>

    <p align="justify">The project's aim is to develop a website that serves as an encyclopedia for the medical condition analysis app
        and can allay users' anxieties about it. They may use this website to research illnesses and their symptoms to
        fully understand the app before utilizing it. Additionally, it increases users' awareness of their health and
        provides information on the closest drugstore and hospital. Two of the most precise objectives we established to
        ensure the success of our project were to finish this application.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">The first goal is to encourage visitors to visit and use our website. This is important for maintaining
        activities and making further enhancements that are required for the project. All ages will be represented among
        the targeted consumers. Additionally, individuals must watch over the elderly and children when they use the
        program. Additionally, user feedback is crucial to enhancing the app's UI aesthetic and usability.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">The second goal is to provide reliable information regarding illnesses and symptoms based on user concerns. Users
        will be able to seek out the most complete and reliable information on sickness on this website, with the
        assistance of medical specialists. With this knowledge, they can help consumers comprehend potential medical
        concerns, make decisions, and seek medical assistance. As a consequence, consumers will be more aware of their
        health issues.</p>

    <h3>Plans and Progress</h3>

    <p align="justify">Planning and strategizing are critical aspects of every successful project since they determine many other
        factors such as resource allocation, risk mitigation, task sequencing, communication, and so on, all of which
        directly contribute to the project's operational effectiveness. Understanding that had led us to the thought of
        creating a highly specific strategy for the project as well as for each member of our team in this endeavor. In
        this section, we will discuss the important components of our project, such as the "story" of the project, the
        main stages of the project, and what happens inside it (decisions, revisions, and some dead ends).</p>
    <p align="justify">Our team's "story" about constructing a promotional website began when assignment 2 was initially posted. At the
        moment, in order to pick the topic for IT production, which is obviously a critical part since there are several
        things to consider such as scope and limits, restricted knowledge and abilities, kind of product, and so on, We
        chose to create a 3D game called "The World of Aristo" after much deliberation, which ended with a fantasy
        setting and an intriguing narrative. Everything appeared fine at first as we sat together for hours only to
        develop the narrative, character, and communication, which is really good because we share a shared love of
        video games. However, once we realize that a prototype is required, we realize that we lack the necessary
        expertise and abilities to manifest our idea. That was a difficult period for our team since we were really
        focused and ambitious with this project, and we also nearly ran out of time because we spent so much time on it.
        We immediately sat down again to adjust our approach to the project in order to capitalize on the previous
        endeavor. Finally, the concept was developed into "theworldofaristo.com" - a website based on the concept of our
        previous game "The World Of Aristo" that would give all required information for players about the world,
        characters, news updates, community, and so on.</p>

    <p align="justify">Project Initiation, Project Planning, Requirement Planning, Design and Architecture, Development and
        Implementation, Testing and Quality Assurance are the five major stages in the production of an IT project. Here
        is a full account of our progress:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Project Initiation: Identifying the need for the IT project, defining the project's objectives, and determining
            its viability are all part of this step. It involves tasks like performing a feasibility assessment and
            establishing the scope of the project. We were able to establish a correct scope for the project since our team
            understood the features of the product and had a clear idea of our expertise and competence. This has aided us
            in the planning process because we now know exactly what section will appear on the website.</li>
            <br>
    
            <li>Project Planning: During this stage, our team creates a detailed project plan that describes the project's
            timetable, resources, deliverables, and activities needed to meet the project objectives. Defining project
            milestones, developing a work breakdown structure, and estimating effort are all part of this. Everything about
            a project must be carefully reviewed in this section, since one erroneous hint from the project manager might
            lead to a domino effect in operational efficiency. Recognizing this, our project manager assigned duties to each
            team member based on their strengths and desires. This allows everyone to give it their all while also making
            extra learning easy because each person just needs to master particular areas. When it comes to project
            timelines, the project manager must determine who is accessible and how busy their calendars are for this one.
            This has aided us in developing a project timeline and determining timeframes for each milestone. In terms of
            communication, we choose to have a face-to-face meeting once per week (depending on the available time of each
            member each week) and other forms of meetings to boost communication flexibility.</li>
            <br>
    
            <li>Design and Architecture: Based on the requirements received, our team produces the system architecture and a
            complete design specification. Designing the user interface, database structure, and software components are all
            part of this. An IT project's design and architecture phases include generating a plan for the system to be
            constructed. Our time is spent studying the project requirements and comprehending its goals. The system
            architecture is then designed, with important components and their relationships identified. Following that is
            detailed design, which specifies interfaces, data structures, algorithms, and logic for each component. User
            interface design is made for projects that require a UI, whereas database design is created for projects that
            require data storage. Integration points and protocols are created to meet the needs of system integration. The
            choice of relevant technologies, frameworks, and tools is also taken into account. Design choices are captured
            in documentation and communicated to the team. Iterative modifications and design reviews guarantee that the
            design fulfills requirements and best practices. Throughout the process, team members must always collaborate
            and communicate with one another.</li>
            <br>
    
            <li>Development and Implementation: The development stage includes writing code and constructing the IT project in
            accordance with the design parameters. It entails tasks including creating code, constructing software modules,
            setting hardware and software infrastructure, and unit testing. Our team turns the concept into code, customizes
            existing software as needed, and combines various components in this section. To assure quality, the program is
            thoroughly tested before being deployed to the production environment. We must also perform additional learning
            during the process because, as freshmen, we are unfamiliar with many new technologies and even programming
            languages.</li>
            <br>
    
            <li>Testing and Quality Assurance: After development is completed, the IT project is subjected to a variety of
            testing operations to guarantee functionality, dependability, and performance. Unit testing, integration
            testing, system testing, and user acceptability testing are all included. During this stage, quality assurance
            tasks like code reviews and bug repair are also carried out. In this section, our team develops test plans and
            executes test cases to ensure functionality, performance, security, and usability. Quality assurance operations,
            such as code reviews and procedure adherence, are carried out to prevent regression issues and contribute to
            continuous development. To secure a good conclusion, collaboration and communication are essential throughout
            the testing phase.</li>
            <br>
        </ul>

        <br>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Scope and Limits</h3>

    <p align="justify">In this project,we will create an application about medical assistants that provides users with all the
        information they need about the disease they are stuck with. Furthermore, this application can get access to a
        camera and transform it into an x-ray,which can cure any disease inside the body. We also have live doctor
        consultations, which will help the users have an appointment with the professional doctors, and they will give
        you the best advice and medicine.</p>

    <p align="justify">There will be a lot of features to do to improve this application, but time is limited, so we decided to add just
        some features that will be enough to serve people. First, we will make two modes that are used for different
        purposes: Normal mode,which is used for scanning outside the body,is perfect for everyone who is having a skin
        disease, and endoscopy mode, which is used for scanning inside the body,is perfect for everyone who is having
        cardiac ischemic disease, a lower respiratory tract infection, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Second,
        we have booking systems that allow you to schedule an appointment with one of our healthcare professionals
        without having to wait for turns. Third, we have a live chat function that allows users to conduct chats with
        medical specialists 24 hours a day, seven days a week, guaranteeing convenient access to medical advice that is
        just a few phone taps away. Finally, we have the deployment of prescription functionality, which streamlines the
        process by allowing medical experts to prescribe prescriptions to consumers or pharmacies and assists users in
        saving time while searching for good medicine on Google, Safari, and Firefox.</p>

    <p align="justify">The first issue that each student has when working on this assignment is a lack of time. It takes years to design
        the perfect app, but we just have two weeks. Furthermore, stress will befall us since we must fulfill deadlines
        for other topics in addition to this one, leaving us dejected and exhausted. Finally, this is the deadline for
        collaboration, there are a lot of things to complete for each individual, even if we divide them.</p>
    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>

    <p align="justify">There are some software and other tools that are involved throughout this project. First of all, we have to
        design a text by using VS Code, Notepad or Python to write a language - HTML to make a text be presented in a
        website. In addition, CSS which is also a language to add styles to web pages, is similar to HTML in making a
        document. Moreover, we need to use other languages such as SQL or Python to store and manage information in the
        web browser and the app. In detail, saving symptoms of different diseases and providing the prescription based
        on the ailment by applying databases are significantly essential while designing the website and the app as
        well. Secondly, X-ray technology is included in our app to diagnose patient’s diseases or check their health
        status. Then the appointment tool will offer several time frames to have a conservation with the professional.
        Last but not least, there is an online environment - Github for us to use Git which can store all history
        changes in files such as changed contents or date and time of modification and every member is able to
        communicate and work on the project via this environment. Thus laptops will be used during our implementation.
        By learning VS Code, Pycharm to write HTML, CSS at the university, our team has some experiences in these areas.</p>
    
    <h3>Testing</h3>
    
    <p align="justify">Our team has already set up a plan to test the app whether it is working in the right way. In detail, the process
        and results will be identified to ensure that the less problems exist, the more complete the app becomes. For
        instance, some features which play an important role for checking the operation of the project, are accessed by
        users such as interaction on the app interface, amount of time to approach assist. After the goals are defined,
        the following step is looking for test participants because the feedback is extremely vital to collect and
        improve. The quantity of users is based on the range of various diseases which are included in the app so that
        there are at least 20 - 25 users in this test. To find out test participants, some strategies are applied to
        catch their attention such as allowing users to self-diagnose and treat minor to moderate injuries and ailments
        by using x-ray, online communication with medical professionals and having ability to carry out prescription
        functionality via social media platforms or advertisements. The users are not required to have any particular
        background due to the purpose of receiving a diverse group of participants. In addition, it also consists of
        experts with different degrees of technical expertise. As a result, we can enhance several knowledge about
        testing, identifying the process, targets and figuring out if there are any possible problems.</p>

    <p align="justify">A successful project involves a mix of components such as technologies, tools, software, hardware, and even the
        interaction between team members in the organization. As a result, we constantly endeavor to explicitly describe
        any risks that may arise throughout the project execution process. To begin, consider the hazards associated
        with technology. Issues in website code can occur due to incorrect syntax or the absence of many HTML tag
        components, which can lead to semantic issues. As a result, the website may fail to function or produce results
        that differ from what is anticipated.</p>

    <p align="justify">The first are the hazards associated with technology. Issues in website code can occur due to incorrect syntax or
        the absence of many HTML tag components, which can lead to semantic issues. As a result, the website may fail to
        function or produce results that differ from what is anticipated. Furthermore, there is a possibility that the
        website could perform slowly due to technical concerns. As a result, precise precision is required during the
        coding process to eliminate dangers. Furthermore, paying close attention to the content of the website but
        failing to give it an obvious and appealing performance leads to the project being less appealing to users and
        decreasing the project's success.</p>
    <p align="justify">Arguments among team members regarding the idea, plan, and how to execute it may put the project in danger of
        failure, or, more subtly, they may slow the project's development and cause it to be completed late. In this
        circumstance, the position of a leader or project manager is critical because he will know how to mix all the
        diverse ideas to make the most perfect concept and then efficiently implement it.</p>

    <p align="justify">These are all potential risks associated with our project. However, we are attempting to limit it in order for
        our website to obtain the greatest outcomes.</p>
